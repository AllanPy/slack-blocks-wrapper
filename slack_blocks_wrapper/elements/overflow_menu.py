    """
    Works with block types: `Section`, `Actions` \n
    This is like a cross between a button and a select menu - when a user
    clicks on this overflow button, they will be presented with a list of
    options to choose from. Unlike the select menu, there is no typeahead field,
    and the button always appears with an ellipsis ("â€¦") rather than customisable text. \n

    As such, it is usually used if you want a more compact layout than a
     select menu, or to supply a list of less visually important actions after
     a row of buttons. You can also specify simple URL links as overflow menu
     options, instead of actions.

     Args:
        options (list): A list of options to be displayed in the overflow menu.
        action_id (str): The action id of the overflow menu.
        confirm (dict): Confirm object

    Returns:
        dict: The overflow menu object.
